# AWS CloudFormation?

AWS CloudFormation is  a service that lets you configure, deploy, update and delete your AWS resources. You can create a CloudFormation template that describes all the AWS resources that you want and CloudFormation will take care of provisioning and configuring those resources on your behalf. These templates can also be re-used to quickly replicate your resources to other regions or to make changes to your existing infrastructure.

For additional reading, please see: [What is AWS CloudFormation?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)

A CloudFormation template is a text file that is either YAML or JSON format that describes a stack - a collection of AWS resources that you want to deploy together as a group.
